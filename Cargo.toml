# Initially this project used phils implementation found here
# https://docs.rs/pic8259/0.10.1/pic8259/index.html 
# I identified some typos and made changes to it, creating a pull request
# At the time of writing this, Phil hasn't accepted the request yet
# I decided to use my local fork of this fork of his implementation
# with my changes here. 
# If you are trying to build this, you can find my forked version on github at
# https://github.com/Virux/pic8259 
# You can simply comment line 35 out like in line 34(just for demo) 
# and uncomment line 36 to use Phil's code and it will compile just fine.
